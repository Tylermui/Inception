# Distorted Image Assignment

In this assignment, you are given 2 Java classes (`ImageBuster` and `SimpleImage` in the `src` directory) that you are going to use to decode a `secret.png` image located in the `img` directory.

Your code will go in the [ImageBuster.java](src/ImageBuster.java) file. Inside of that file, you will find your task at hand as well as the workflow to execute it. The [SimpleImage.java](src/SimpleImage.java) file is already written up and you do NOT have to change anything there; just use it as it is. You can use [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) to load the whole `DistortedImageStarter` project. Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), etc., only if you are familiar with them.
